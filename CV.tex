	\explanationdetail{%
		Developed an air bearing-based platform and table to provide a free-floating low friction environment for testing a prototype cold gas propulsion system.
		Pneumatic components were acquired off-the-shelf and structural components 3D printed to reduce cost and facilitate dissemination of open-sourced part files.
		The air bearing surface was constructed by placing a sheet of regular window pane glass atop an optics table and shimmed as needed to achieve a functionally level surface.
		% The platform was found to operate marginally at 30 psig with improved functionality up to 50 psig, after which no performance improvements were observed.
		It was found that debris and inconsistencies in the table surface were the main contributors to degraded performance, and new facilities are being constructed to house the table and mitigate surface debris.
		% The system was required to operate independent of any external power or gas supplies and maintain a small footprint to maximize usable table space.
		% The design of the platform was driven by performance and cost constraints of the air bearings
		% Three air bearings were mounted to threaded ball studs in a triangular configuration and held in place by a 3D-printed structure.
		% This same structure supported 2x 9-oz. CO$_{2}$ bottles, a regulator, an air filter, and the propulsion system.
		% The air bearing table was constructed by placing a 0.125''-thick pane of glass atop a 3' x 5' optics bench and shimmed with 0.1-mm Kapton tape to minimize surface deviations.

		Constructed a wireless electronic control system for the cold gas propulsion system prototype using a NodeMCU microcontroller to drive valves via motor controllers and collect data from pressure transducers.
		% The circuitry was packed on a custom-designed printed circuit board (PCB).
		The NodeMCU was chosen as a low-cost platform which could wirelessly communicate with a Raspberry Pi-based message broker using an MQTT framework.
		NodeJS was used on the Raspberry Pi to simultaneously host the MQTT message broker and an HTTP server to allow users to send commands to the propulsion system via a web interface.
		The same framework was used to support data collection during static thrust testing by wirelessly relaying strain gauge and pressure measurements to the broker which then stored the data in a database for post-processing.

		\explanationdetail{%
			Developed a Python-based computer vision algorithm to measure position, velocity, and acceleration of a free-floating air bearing platform from recorded video.
			The algorithm detected a fiducial marker placed on the platform and returned a timeseries dataset of relative pose for each frame in the video.
			This dataset was then passed to a Kalman filter which combined the data with a kinematic model to estimate the velocity and acceleration of the platform over time.
			These tools allowed a user to detect accelerations due to thrust and friction and quantitatively compare the effects of different combinations of thruster failures.

		\datedexperience{\href{https://github.com/jwday/nozzleDesign}{\color{black}{Gas Dynamics Simulation for Single Plenum Discharge \faGithubSquare}}}{}
		\explanationdetail{%
			Developed a Python-based gas dynamics simulation to predict the performance characteristics of the plenum-based propulsion system by modeling the change in propellant thermodynamic properties during a discharge process.
			The change in gas properties with each time step was modeled assuming an isentropic process for an ideal gas, and the corresponding thruster performance was calculated assuming an isentropic process through the nozzle.
			Further development replaced the isentropic model inside the plenum with interpolated thermodynamic data for real gasses to more accurately predict the temperature change during a discharge.
			Simulation results were experimentally validated by measuring pressure and thrust during a discharge, which were found to be in good agreement after the completion of an initial start-up phase whereby the mass flow rate and thrust increased to a maximum before decaying.
			% The modeled process was found to be in the same family as that of a rocket nozzle during its shut-off phase, with the exception of a brief period in the beginning where mass flow rate and thrust must first rise to a maximum before decaying.

		\explanationdetail{%
			Constructed propellant storage volumes ('plenums') to store gaseous CO2 at 100 psig using an off-the-shelf benchtop 3D printer for use in on-ground propulsion system testing.
			A process was developed to finish and seal the 3D printed components with two-part epoxy and securely bond a threaded fitting to allow the plenums to be mated directly to the propulsion control valves.
			Aided by CAD-based stress analysis, several iterations were produced with varying connectors, geometry, and print methods in order to produce a final version which could be reliably printed in a short amount of time.
			Each plenum underwent proof testing to double its expected pressure (200 psig) using water to minimize explosive energy in event of failure.

		\explanationdetail{%
			A Multibody Dynamics class project which used Python to implement Kane's Method of dynamic analysis to model a rotating torus in free space as system mass is shifted to offset the center of gravity.
			The motivation for this project was to explore the use of rotation to simulate gravity in a theoretical space station design and explore how internal disturbances could affect the dynamics of the rotation.
			A simply-rotating body with point masses around the circumference was modeled using the appropriate formulation, but the specific challenge lied in accessing the location of the point masses during the integration routine and changing them mid-step.
			% As expected, entirely in-plane motion resulted in simple translation of the center of mass while rotation remained in-plane.
			% More interestingly, some out-of-plane motion of the point masses resulted in a visible ``wobble'', necessitating the introduction of counter-balance masses which would be used to preserve system stability.

		\explanationdetail{%
			A personal Discord bot created using the Discord.js library as an exercise to become more familiarzed with javaScript, specifically non-sequential function calls.
			Main features include chat-based Google search, playing YouTube audio, and an emoji react-controlled ``sound board'' to prompt the bot to play sound effects when a chat message is reacted to with pre-specified emoji(s).
			Specific challenges involved tightly managing event listener creation to prevent different instances from interfering with each other, using javaScript 'cavas' library to create Star Trek-inspired logos, and learning to use 'async' and 'await' functions to handle responsive delays (such as in API calls).
