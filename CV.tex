			% \item As lead TA for Engineering Design \& Communications, assisted with lesson plan development and supervised three bi-weekly lab sessions consisting of 6 teams of 4 students, each with their own individual project needs.
			\item \emph{Engineering Design \& Communications} -- As lead TA, assisted lesson plan development, gave weekly lectures introducing students to sensors and microcontrollers, and provided critical feedback on public speaking and technical communication.
			% \item Applied experience with programming, sensors, and actuators to introduce students to data collection with microcontrollers and guide team projects to address problems identified on the UC Davis Student Farm.
			% \item Provided effective feedback to students engaged in public speaking and presentations, citing notable improvement in technical communication and public speaking skills from beginning to end of quarter.
			\item \emph{Measurement Systems} -- Supervised weekly lab sessions introducing students to electro-mechanical sensors such as op-amps and strain gauges to measure bending stress and accelerometers to identify vibrational modes.
			\item \emph{Manufacturing Processes} -- Instructed students on safe operation of manual fabrication equipment and proper use of geometric dimensioning and tolerancing, leading each student in the construction of their own personalized gyroscope.
