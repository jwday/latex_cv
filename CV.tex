	\datedexperience{\href{https://github.com/jwday/ABTestbed}{\color{black}{Air Bearing-based Propulsion System Testbed \faGithubSquare}}}{}
	\explanationdetail{%
		An air bearing-based platform and table was developed to provide a free-floating low friction environment for testing a prototype cold gas propulsion system.
		Pneumatic components were acquired off-the-shelf and structural components 3D printed to reduce cost and enable facilitate dissemination of open-sourced part files.
		The air bearing surface was constructed by placing a sheet of regular window pane glass atop an optics table and shimmed as needed to achieve a functionally level surface.
		% The platform was found to operate marginally at 30 psig with improved functionality up to 50 psig, after which no performance improvements were observed.
		It was found that debris and inconsistencies in the table surface were the main contributors to degraded performance, and new facilities are being constructed to house the table and mitigate surface debris.
		% The system was required to operate independent of any external power or gas supplies and maintain a small footprint to maximize usable table space.
		% The design of the platform was driven by performance and cost constraints of the air bearings
		% Three air bearings were mounted to threaded ball studs in a triangular configuration and held in place by a 3D-printed structure.
		% This same structure supported 2x 9-oz. CO$_{2}$ bottles, a regulator, an air filter, and the propulsion system.
		% The air bearing table was constructed by placing a 0.125''-thick pane of glass atop a 3' x 5' optics bench and shimmed with 0.1-mm Kapton tape to minimize surface deviations.

	\datedexperience{\href{https://github.com/jwday/remoteProp}{\color{black}{Arduino and Raspberry Pi-based Wireless Propulsion Controller \faGithubSquare}}}{}
	\explanationdetail{%
		A propulsion system consisting of twelve solenoid valves and two pressure transducers was controlled using an Arduino-like NodeMCU microcontroller and additional components laid out on a custom-designed printed circuit board (PCB).
		The NodeMCU was chosen as a low-cost platform which could wirelessly communicate with a message broker using a simple MQTT framework.
		The Raspberry Pi simultaneously hosted the MQTT message broker and an HTTP server to allow clients to send commands to the propulsion system via a web interface.
		The same framework was used to support data collection during thrust testing by wirelessly relaying strain gauge and pressure measurements to the broker which then stored the data in a database for post-processing.

	\datedexperience{\href{https://github.com/jwday/ComputerVision}{\color{black}{Computer Vision System and Kalman Filter Data Post-processor \faGithubSquare}}}{}
	\explanationdetail{%
		Position, velocity, and acceleration of a free-floating air bearing platform was measured using a Python-based computer vision algorithm on recorded video.
		The algorithm detects a fiducial marker placed on the platform and returns a timeseries dataset of relative pose for each frame in the video.
		The dataset is passed to a Kalman filter which combines the data with a kinematic model to estimate the velocity and acceleration of the platform over time.
		These tools allow a user to detect accelerations due to thrust and friction, and quantitatively compare the effects of different combinations of thruster failures.

	\datedexperience{\href{https://github.com/jwday/3D-printed-plenum}{\color{black}{3D Printed Propellant Pressure Vessel \faGithubSquare}}}{}
	\explanationdetail{%
		Propellant storage volumes ('plenums') were constructed to store CO2 propellant at 100 psig using an off-the-shelf benchtop 3D printer.
		A process was developed to finish and seal the 3D printed components with two-part epoxy and securely bond a threaded fitting to allow the plenums to be mated directly to the propulsion control valves.
		Aided by CAD-based stress analysis, several iterations were produced with varying connectors, geometry, and print methods in order to produce a final version which could be reliably printed in a short amount of time.
		Each plenum underwent proof testing to double its expected pressure (200 psig) using water to minimize explosive energy in event of failure.
	}
	\datedexperience{\href{https://github.com/jwday/nozzleDesign}{\color{black}{Gas Dynamics Simulation for Single Plenum Discharge \faGithubSquare}}}{}
	\explanationdetail{%
		A Python-based gas dynamics simulation was developed to predict the performance characteristics of the plenum-based propulsion system by modeling the change in propellant thermodynamic properties during a discharge process.
		The change in gas properties with each time step was modeled assuming an isentropic process for an ideal gas, and the corresponding thruster performance was calculated assuming an isentropic process through the nozzle.
		Further development replaced the isentropic model inside the plenum with interpolated thermodynamic data for real gasses to more accurately predict the temperature change during a discharge.
		Simulation results were experimentally validated by measuring pressure and thrust during a discharge, which were found to be in good agreement after the completion of an initial start-up phase whereby the mass flow rate and thrust increased to a maximum before decaying.
		% The modeled process was found to be in the same family as that of a rocket nozzle during its shut-off phase, with the exception of a brief period in the beginning where mass flow rate and thrust must first rise to a maximum before decaying.
	}
	\datedexperience{\href{https://github.com/jwday/rotating-torus-sympy}{\color{black}{Dynamics Modeling of a Rotating Torus with Time-Varying Mass Distribution \faGithubSquare}}}{}
	\explanationdetail{%
		A Multibody Dynamics class project which used Python to implement Kane's Method of dynamic analysis to model a rotating torus in free space as system mass is shifted to offset the center of gravity.
		The motivation for this project was to explore the use of rotation to simulate gravity in a theoretical space station design and explore how internal disturbances could affect the dynamics of the rotation.
		A simply-rotating body with point masses around the circumference was modeled using the appropriate formulation, but the specific challenge lied in accessing the location of the point masses during the integration routine and changing them mid-step.
		As expected, entirely in-plane motion resulted in simple translation of the center of mass while rotation remained in-plane.
		More interestingly, some out-of-plane motion of the point masses resulted in a visible ``wobble'', necessitating the introduction of counter-balance masses which would be used to preserve system stability.
